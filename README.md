**Usage**

You can use this program in MATLAB or Octave (open-source MATLAB). Instructions on how to use it are in the program itself, so hopefully it is self-explanatory.

**Setup**

Some helpful commands for setting this up in Octave and maybe MATLAB:

addpath("folder_path"), where file_path is the location of the folder where the program file is stored. On Windows, you can open the folder in File Explorer and copy the path from the address bar. When you paste, though, you'll need to replace all the back slashes with forward slashes for it to work.

savepath, saves the path you just added with the addpath() command.
